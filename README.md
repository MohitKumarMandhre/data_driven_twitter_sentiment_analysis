# Overview

Hashtag Real-Time Sentiment Analysis System is a sophisticated project designed to analyze social media trends, particularly on Twitter (X), using a robust pipeline of technologies. The primary objective is to leverage data-driven business insights to assist companies in assessing and forecasting public sentiment on trending topics. This system aims to bridge the gap between data and people, offering a unique window into data-driven analytics and enhancing businesses' ability to make informed decisions based on real-time public opinion.

# Project Description

Hashtag Real-Time Sentiment Analysis System employs a comprehensive technology stack including Kafka, Spark Streaming, PostgreSQL, Power BI, and Spring Boot. The system utilizes external libraries such as NLTK for Natural Language Processing (NLP) based sentiment analysis of tweets and trends, and TF-IDF for trend generation. The integration of these technologies enables the real-time processing and analysis of social media data, providing valuable insights into public sentiment.

# Technology Stack

Apache Kafka: Serves as the backbone for data streaming, ensuring the reliable transmission of tweets for analysis.
Apache Spark Streaming: Facilitates real-time data processing and analytics, allowing for the immediate assessment of public sentiment.
PostgreSQL: A robust relational database system used to store processed data and analytical results.
Power BI: A powerful business analytics tool used to visualize and present insights derived from the data.
Spring Boot: Provides a framework for building and running the application, ensuring smooth integration of all components.

# Key Features

Real-Time Sentiment Analysis: Leverages NLTK for NLP-based sentiment analysis, providing instant feedback on public opinion regarding trending topics.
Trend Generation: Utilizes TF-IDF to identify and generate trends from the collected tweets, ensuring the most relevant topics are analyzed.
Data Visualization: Employs Power BI to create dynamic and interactive visualizations, making it easier for businesses to understand and interpret the data.
